1. Create a db.json file and start a mock json server.
   Then you can persist the tasks.
   Then use Angulars HTTP Client module for CRUD operations.
   By adding API integration to your task app, you'll learn:

HTTP Client Module: How to use Angular's HttpClient for CRUD operations
Observables and Subscriptions: Working with RxJS for handling asynchronous API responses
Services Pattern: Implementing proper service layers to abstract API calls
Error Handling: Managing API errors and providing user feedback
Loading States: Showing loading indicators during API operations
Interceptors: Adding request/response interceptors for auth tokens or logging
Caching Strategies: Implementing client-side caching for performance
Optimistic Updates: Updating UI before API responses for better UX
Retry Logic: Handling network failures with retry mechanisms
Pagination: Implementing server-side pagination for large datasets


2. Custom Pipes for Task Formatting
Create pipes for formatting dates, priorities, or task descriptions
Learn about Angular's transformation logic
Understand pipe performance considerations

3. Task Search with RxJS (as you mentioned)
Implement a search bar that filters tasks in real-time
Learn about RxJS operators like debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged, and switchMap
Understand reactive programming patterns in Angular


5. Custom Structural Directives
Create a directive for conditional rendering based on task properties
Build a directive for repeating elements based on priority levels

6. NgRx for State Management
   Implement a shared state service using BehaviorSubject
Try using the Mediator pattern for complex component interactions
Implement NgRx for managing task state
Learn about NgRx architecture and best practices
Understand selectors, effects, and reducers

4. Testing Strategies
Write comprehensive unit tests for your task service
Create component tests with different testing approaches
Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
Learn about testing asynchronous operations
